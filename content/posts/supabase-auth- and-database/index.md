## Introduction:
.NET MAUI (Multi-Platform App UI) is an innovative cross-platform framework that allows developers to create native apps for multiple platforms using a single codebase. In this blog post, we'll explore in detail how to leverage Supabase's powerful database and authentication features within a .NET MAUI project. By integrating Supabase, you can create robust, scalable, and secure applications. Let's dive deep into the process and unlock the full potential of this dynamic combination.

## Prerequisites:
Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Installed .NET 6 Preview SDK or a higher version.
2. A Supabase account. If you don't have one, sign up for free at Supabase (https://supabase.io/).

## Setting Up the .NET MAUI Project:
1. Begin by creating a new .NET MAUI project using your preferred development environment, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider.
2. Configure the project's target platforms according to your requirements, such as Android, iOS, and/or Windows.
3. Install the necessary NuGet packages for working with Supabase and its dependencies:
   - Supabase.NET: Install the Supabase.Client package.
   - Newtonsoft.Json: Install the Newtonsoft.Json package for JSON serialization.

## Initializing Supabase Credentials:
1. Create an instance of the SupabaseClient in the Startup.cs file or its equivalent:

```csharp
using Supabase.Client;
var supabase = new SupabaseClient("YOUR_SUPABASE_URL", "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY");
```

Make sure to replace "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL" and "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" with your actual Supabase project URL and anonymous key.

## Working with the Supabase Database:
1. Utilize the SupabaseClient instance created earlier to perform database operations:
   - To fetch data from a specific table:

```bash
var todos = await supabase 
.From("todos")
.Select("*")
.ExecuteAsync();
```

   - To insert data into a table:

```bash
var newTodo = await supabase
.From("todos")
.Insert(new { title = "New Task",  completed = false })
.SingleAsync();
```

   - Perform update and delete operations using the corresponding methods available in the SupabaseClient.

## Implementing Supabase Authentication:
To utilize Supabase's authentication features, install the Supabase.Auth package in your project.

```bash
using Supabase.Auth;
var supabaseAuth = new SupabaseAuth("YOUR_SUPABASE_URL",
"YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY");
```
   
Replace "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL" and "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" with your actual Supabase project URL and anonymous key.
Take advantage of the various authentication methods provided by the SupabaseAuth class:
   - For user registration:

```bash
var user = await supabaseAuth
.SignUpWithEmailAsync("email@example.com",
"password");
```

   - For user login:

```bash
var user = await supabaseAuth
.SignInWithEmailAsync("email@example.com",
"password");
```

   - For user logout:

```bash
await supabaseAuth.SignOutAsync();
```

## Conclusion:
By integrating Supabase's powerful database and authentication features into your .NET MAUI project, you empower it with scalable data storage and secure user authentication. In this comprehensive guide, we walked through the step-by-step process of setting up Supabase, initializing credentials, working with the database, and implementing authentication. With these capabilities at your disposal, you can create feature-rich, cross-platform applications that are both robust and secure. So, seize the opportunity and unlock the full potential of Supabase in your .NET MAUI projects today!
