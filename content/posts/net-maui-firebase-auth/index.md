## Introduction

Firebase Authentication is a popular service offered by Google that provide easy-to-use tools for authenticating users in your applications. In this blog post, we explore how to integrate Firebase Authentication into a .NET MAUI application, allowing you to quickly and securely authenticate users using the provider email and password. Let dive in!

## Step 1: Set Up Firebase Project

To get started, create a Firebase project (if you haven`t already) by visiting the Firebase Console (console.firebase.google.com) and clicking on "Add Project". Give your project a name and follow the setup instructions to create your Firebase project.

## Step 2: Enable Firebase Authentication

One your project is created, navigate to the Authentication section in the Firebase Console. Here, you can enable the authentication providers you want to use in your application, such as Email/password, Google, Facebook, etc.

## Step 3: Install Firebase NuGet Packages

In your .NET MAUI project, open the NuGet package manager and search for the following Firebase packages:

* FirebaseAdmin
* Google.Cloud.Firestore
* Xamarin.Firebase.IOS.Auth (for IOS)
* Xamarin.Firebase.Android.Auth (for Android)

Install these packages in your project to gain access to the Firebase Authentication unctionalities.

## Step 4: Connect .NET MAUI Project to Firebase

 To establish a connection between your .NET MAUI project and Firebase, you need to configure the Firebase project credentials within your application. This requires downloading a JSON file from the Firebase Console and placing it in the appropriate location in your .NET MAUI project.

 For IOS:

 * Download the GoogleService-Info.plist file from Firebase Console.
 * In your IOS project, right-click on the root folder and select "Add Files". Choose the downloaded plist file and ensure it is added to the project and marked as "Copy if newer" for the build action

 For Android:

 * Download the GoogleService-Info.plist file from the Firebase Console.
 * In your Android project, right-click on the root folder and select "Add Files". Choose the downloaded JSON file and ensure it is added to the project and marked as "GoogleServicesJson" for the build action.

## Step 5: Implement Firebase Authentication in .NET MAUI

Now that your project is connected to Firebase, you can start using Firebase Authentication in your :NET MAUI application.

First, import the necessary Firebase namespaces:

```bash
using FirebaseAdmin;
using Google.Apis.OAuth2;
using Xamarin.Firebase.Auth;
```

Next, initialize Firebase in your app`s startup code:

```bash
FirebaseApp.Create(new AppOptions()
{
    Credential = GoogleCredential.FromFile("path/to/your/credentials.json")
});
```

To authenticate a user, you can use the FirebaseAuth class:

```bash
var authProvider = new FirebaseAuthProvider(new FirebaseConfig("<firebase-project-id>"));
var auth = await
authProvider.SignInWithEmailAndPasswordAsync(email, password);
```

You can also use other authentication providers such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter by calling their respective SignIn methods.

## Step 6: Handling Authentication State

To handle the authentication state, you can subscribe to the AuthStateChanged event of the FirebaseAuth class, which will be triggered whenever the user`s authentication state changes.

```bash
authProvider.Auth.StateChanged += (sender, e) => 
{
    if(e.Auth.CurrentUser != null)
    {
        //User is authenticated
    }
    else
    {
        //User is not authenticated
    }
};
```

## Step 7: Additional Firebase Authentication Features

Firebase Authentication provides several additional features, such as user registration, password reset, and custom claims. You can explore these features in the Firebase documentation (firebase.google.com/docs/auth).

## Conclusion

Integrating Firebase Authentication into your .NET MAUI application allows you to leverage the secure and powerful authentication services provided by Google. By following the step outlined in this blog post, you can easily authenticate users using various providers and enhance the user experience of your application. Happy coding!
