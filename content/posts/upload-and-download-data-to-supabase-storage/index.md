## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on uploading and downloading data from and to Supabase Storage! In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage the power of .NET and MAUI to interact with Supabase's data storage service.

Supabase Storage provides a secure and scalable solution for storing and retrieving files in your applications. Whether you need to upload user-generated content, serve static assets, or handle file management, Supabase Storage has got you covered.

Throughout this guide, we will cover the essential concepts, step-by-step instructions, and best practices for integrating Supabase Storage into your .NET and MAUI projects. By the end, you will have a solid understanding of how to effectively upload and download data, ensuring a seamless user experience.

So, let's dive in and discover the power of Supabase Storage in combination with .NET and MAUI!

## Step 1: Set Up Firebase Project

To get started, create a Firebase project (if you haven`t already) by visiting the Firebase Console (console.firebase.google.com) and clicking on "Add Project". Give your project a name and follow the setup instructions to create your Firebase project.

## Step 2/1: Create a bucket

To create a bucket in Supabase Storage, follow these steps:

1. Open the Supabase Dashboard and navigate to the "Storage" section.
2. Click on the "Buckets" tab.
3. Click on the "Create Bucket" button.
4. Provide a name for your bucket.
5. Choose the region where you want your bucket to be located.
6. Optionally, you can set the access control rules for your bucket.
7. Click on the "Create" button to create the bucket.

Once the bucket is created, you can start uploading and managing files in Supabase Storage.

## Step 2/2: Create a bucket in your application

1. Import the necessary namespace or module for the Supabase client.
2. Declare a private field _supabaseClient of type Supabase.Client to hold an instance of the Supabase client.
3. Define a constructor for the YourViewModel class that takes a Supabase.Client object as a parameter.
4. Inside the constructor, assign the passed supabaseClient parameter to the _supabaseClient field.
5. Define a private asynchronous method CreateBucket() that returns a Task.
6. Within the CreateBucket() method, use a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions.
7. Inside the try block, call the CreateBucket() method on the _supabaseClient.Storage object, passing the name of the bucket as a string ("pictures").
8. If the bucket creation is successful, output a debug message using Debug.WriteLine().
9. If an exception occurs, catch it and output the error message using Debug.WriteLine().

It's important to note that this code assumes the existence of a Supabase client library and its associated classes and methods. Additionally, the code uses the Debug.WriteLine() method to output debug messages, so make sure to import the appropriate namespace for that as well.

```csharp
// Initialize the supabase client
private readonly Supabase.Client _supabaseClient;

public YourViewModel(Supabase.Client supabaseClient)
{
	_supabaseClient = supabaseClient;
    CreateBucket();
}

// Create a bucket
private async Taks CreateBucket() 
{
    try 
    {
       var bucket = await _supabaseclient.Storage.CreateBucket("pictures");
        Debug.Writeline("Bucket created successfully");
    } 
    catch (error) 
    {
        Debug.Writeline(ex.Messege);
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Upload data to the Bucket just created

1. Declare a private asynchronous method named UploadDataToBucket() that returns a Task.
2. Inside the method, use a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions.
Within the try block, perform the following steps:

1. Specify the file path of the data to be uploaded by assigning it to the filePath variable.
2. Read the file content using the File.ReadAllBytes() method and assign it to the fileContent variable.
3. Specify the destination path within the bucket by assigning it to the destinationPath variable.
4. Upload the file to the bucket using the _supabaseClient.Storage.UploadFile() method, passing the bucket name, destination path, and file content as parameters. Assign the response to the response variable.
5. Check if the upload was successful by using the IsSuccessStatusCode property of the response object.
6. If the upload was successful, output a debug message using Debug.WriteLine().
7. If the upload failed, output a debug message indicating the failure.
8. In the catch block, catch any exceptions and output the error message using Debug.WriteLine().

Make sure to import the necessary namespaces, such as System.IO for file operations and System.Diagnostics for debugging.

```csharp
// Upload data to the bucket
private async Task UploadDataToBucket()
{
    try
    {
        // Specify the file path of the data to be uploaded
        string filePath = "path/to/your/file.txt";

        // Read the file content
        byte[] fileContent = File.ReadAllBytes(filePath);

        // Specify the destination path within the bucket
        string destinationPath = "folder/file.txt";

        // Upload the file to the bucket
        var response = await _supabaseClient.Storage.UploadFile("pictures", destinationPath, fileContent);

        // Check if the upload was successful
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("File uploaded successfully");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("File upload failed");
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine($"Error uploading file: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Download data from Supabase storage
1. The code snippet is part of a method called DownloadDataFromBucket(), which is responsible for downloading a file from a storage bucket.
2. Inside the method, a try-catch block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the file download process.
3. The first step in the file download process is to specify the path of the file to be downloaded within the storage bucket. In this case, the file path is set to "folder/file.txt".
4. The next step is to call the DownloadFile() method on the _supabaseClient.Storage object. This method takes two parameters: the name of the bucket from which to download the file (in this case, "pictures"), and the file path within the bucket.
5. The DownloadFile() method returns a response object that contains information about the download operation, such as the status code and the downloaded file content.
6. The code then checks if the download was successful by examining the IsSuccessStatusCode property of the response object. If the download was successful, the code proceeds to the next steps. Otherwise, it will handle the failure case.
7. If the download was successful, the code retrieves the downloaded file content by calling the ReadAsByteArrayAsync() method on the Content property of the response object. This method asynchronously reads the file content as a byte array.
8. The downloaded file content is then saved to a local destination by calling the WriteAllBytes() method of the File class. The method takes two parameters: the destination path where the file should be saved (in this case, "path/to/save/file.txt"), and the byte array containing the file content.
9. Finally, a debug message is printed to indicate that the file was downloaded successfully.
That's it! The code snippet demonstrates how to download a file from a storage bucket using the Supabase client library in C#. It handles exceptions, checks the download status, retrieves the file content, and saves it to a local destination.

```csharp
// Download data from the bucket
private async Task DownloadDataFromBucket()
{
    try
    {
        // Specify the path of the file to be downloaded within the bucket
        string filePath = "folder/file.txt";

        // Download the file from the bucket
        var response = await _supabaseClient.Storage.DownloadFile("pictures", filePath);

        // Check if the download was successful
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            // Get the downloaded file content
            byte[] fileContent = await response.Content.ReadAsByteArrayAsync();

            // Save the file to a local destination
            string destinationPath = "path/to/save/file.txt";
            File.WriteAllBytes(destinationPath, fileContent);

            Debug.WriteLine("File downloaded successfully");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("File download failed");
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine($"Error downloading file: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```
